# Primary turn-end supervision guard

This is the authoritative current contract for the "no turn ends blind" primary backstop referenced from AGENTS.md section 8.
The predicate lives in `bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh`.
Primary scope lives in `bin/fm-primary-scope-lib.sh`, shared with the native session-start nudge in [`sessionstart-nudge.md`](sessionstart-nudge.md).
Harness hook files adapt each enabled primary harness integration's turn-end mechanism to that shared predicate.

Related PreToolUse guards deny unsafe commands before execution rather than detecting a blind turn end afterward.
Their separate owners are [`arm-pretool-check.md`](arm-pretool-check.md), [`cd-guard.md`](cd-guard.md), and [`subagent-guard.md`](subagent-guard.md).
Do not infer this guard's scope, loop safety, or compatibility tradeoffs for those guards.

## Current invariant

`bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh` closes the gap by checking the primary's own turn-end path.
When tasks are in flight and neither a live identity-matched watcher with a fresh beacon nor a live always-on daemon lock is present, a harness hook must either block the turn end or force a bounded follow-up turn that tells the primary to repair the missing supervision cycle using the recovery instruction in its emitted session-start protocol.

## Shared predicate

The guard first calls the shared primary scope.
A secondmate home runs its own primary Firstmate session, so a genuine `.fm-secondmate-home` marker includes it whether the home is a linked worktree or plain clone.
The marker must be a regular non-symlink file whose whitespace-stripped first line is a non-empty identifier containing only letters, digits, dots, underscores, and dashes.
An unmarked checkout or invalid marker falls through to the git-dir check.
That check keeps crewmate and scout linked worktrees inert because their git dir differs from their git common dir.
It also requires `AGENTS.md`, `bin/`, and the effective state directory.

For an in-scope primary checkout, it counts in-flight work from `state/*.meta`.
If no task is in flight, it exits silently.
If work is in flight, it first evaluates `fm_watcher_healthy <state-dir> <watch-path> [grace-seconds] [home]` from `bin/fm-wake-lib.sh`.
That is the same identity-matched live lock and fresh beacon check used by `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh`.
A stale beacon blocks even if a watcher pid is still live.
A fresh leftover beacon blocks if the watcher lock is missing, dead, or identity-mismatched.
When the watcher predicate is not satisfied, `daemon_lock_held_by_live_daemon` from the same library is an additional satisfier, never a replacement for the watcher check.
The live daemon guarantees that its one-shot watcher child restarts through the expected brief beacon gap on a supported Claude or Codex primary on tmux or herdr.

`FM_STATE_OVERRIDE` wins over `FM_HOME/state`, and `FM_HOME` wins over repository-root `state/`.
`FM_GUARD_GRACE` controls beacon freshness and defaults to 300 seconds.
If `jq` is missing or hook stdin is empty, the guard exits 0 because it cannot safely read loop-guard fields.

## Harness integrations

- `claude`: `.claude/settings.json` registers a `Stop` hook command anchored through `"$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR"/bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh`.
- Codex registers a `Stop` hook in `.codex/hooks.json`, anchors the executable to the hook process working directory, verifies a Firstmate-shaped hook-bearing root, and passes the original payload to the shared guard.
- OpenCode listens for `session.idle` in `.opencode/plugins/fm-primary-turnend-guard.js`, lets the watcher coordinator act first, and calls `client.session.promptAsync` once when the guard returns 2.
- Pi listens for `agent_settled` in `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-turnend-guard.ts`, runs once per logical agent run, and calls `pi.sendUserMessage(..., { deliverAs: "followUp" })` once when the guard returns 2.
- Grok registers a `Stop` hook in `.grok/hooks/fm-primary-turnend-guard.json` and uses `bin/fm-turnend-guard-grok.sh` to resume the reported session once when the shared guard returns 2.
  The adapter intentionally omits `--permission-mode`, so a passive hook cannot grant stronger permissions than the resumed session default.

Claude and Codex support a direct blocking Stop hook.
For those harnesses, exit status 2 plus stderr from `bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh` blocks the stop and feeds the reason back into the model.
Both payloads include `stop_hook_active`; when it is true, the shared guard exits 0 so the harness can end after one forced continuation.

OpenCode, Pi, and Grok expose passive callbacks for this purpose.
Their adapters fail open at the hook boundary to protect the user session but schedule one bounded follow-up when the predicate blocks.
The generated prompts use the canonical `turn-end-guard` kind after the U+2063 `FIRSTMATE_OP: ` prefix, so Ahoy does not treat them as captain messages.
Each adapter owns a loop latch.
Pi keeps the latch across internal tool turns and clears it only when the generated follow-up settles or delivery fails.
Grok's project hook requires the checkout to be trusted with `/hooks-trust` or launch-time `--trust`.
OpenCode's forced follow-up is supported for persistent TUI sessions and remains fail-open in headless `opencode run`.

If a passive adapter cannot invoke its SDK, find `grok`, or recover a Grok session id, the next pull-based `fm-guard.sh` call reports the problem.
That warning uses `bin/fm-supervision-instructions.sh --repair-line`, so it always points to the active harness protocol rather than embedding another repair command.

## Compatibility limits

- Child crewmate and scout worktrees are outside scope.
- A valid secondmate home is in scope; an idle secondmate endpoint with no X-mode relay poll remains healthy because it has no supervision need.
- Claude and Codex block directly, while OpenCode, Pi, and Grok use bounded passive follow-ups.
- OpenCode headless mode and untrusted Grok project hooks remain fail-open at the host boundary.
- Kimi Code CLI 0.29.1 exposes only global `[[hooks]]` configuration in `${KIMI_CODE_HOME:-$HOME/.kimi-code}/config.toml`, including a `Stop` event with snake_case payload fields `hook_event_name`, `session_id`, `cwd`, and `stop_hook_active`.
- Kimi has no project-level hook configuration and remains outside the primary guard integrations above.
- Captain-approved Kimi crew wake support uses `bin/fm-kimi-turnend-hook.sh` to edit only one marker-delimited Firstmate region in that global config and install a silent always-zero hook.
- The hook remains inert unless the payload `cwd` contains a per-task token pointer that resolves through Firstmate's private registry to one `state/<id>.turn-ended` marker.
- Installation refuses before writing unless `python3` with `tomllib` and `jq` are available.
- If `jq` is removed after installation, the hook remains silent and exits 0, turn-end wakes stop, and Kimi crews fall back to idle detection.
- Unreadable hook input remains fail-open.
- No harness adapter uses a shell ampersand to manufacture supervision.

## Regression coverage

`tests/fm-turnend-guard.test.sh` covers the shared predicate, primary scoping (including a secondmate's own home being guarded like the main primary while its child worktrees stay exempt), `FM_HOME` and `FM_STATE_OVERRIDE` precedence, Pi logical-run latch behavior for no-tool and multi-tool runs, fail-open behavior without `jq`, tracked hook registration for all five harnesses, and the Grok adapter's forced-resume loop guard and permission-mode regression.
`tests/fm-continuity-pretool-check.test.sh` covers the Claude-only continuity PreToolUse gate: recovery-command allowances, the always-on daemon satisfier, and per-backend repair guidance.
`tests/fm-kimi-harness.test.sh` covers the separate Kimi crew hook's format preservation, idempotence, refusal cases, token guard, spawn registration, and teardown cleanup.
The default behavior suite does not invoke live language-model harnesses.
`FM_PI_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-pi-primary-live-e2e.test.sh` opts into the isolated interactive Pi regression, and `FM_CLAUDE_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-claude-continuity-live-e2e.test.sh` opts into the isolated interactive Claude regression.
[`verification/supervision.md`](verification/supervision.md#turn-end-guard) records the active cross-harness empirical evidence.
