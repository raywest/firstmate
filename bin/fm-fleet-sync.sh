# Refresh project clones: fast-forward the checked-out local default branch to
# origin/<default> when safe, and prune local branches whose upstream tracking
# branch is gone (the remote branch was deleted, i.e. its PR merged) and that no
# worktree still needs.
# Self-heals the one unambiguously safe drift: a clean, detached HEAD that holds
# no unique commits (it is an ancestor of origin/<default>) and whose <default>
# branch is free to check out is re-attached and then fast-forwarded ("recovered:").
# Every other off-default state - a non-default named branch, a detached HEAD with
# unique commits, a dirty tree, or a diverged default - may hold real work, so it
# is left untouched and reported as a quantified, loud "STUCK: ... N commits behind
# ... - needs attention" warning rather than a quiet drift. Nothing is ever forced,
# stashed, or discarded.
# A local-only project (no push, no PR, no merge for that delivery mode) still gets
# this same read-only refresh whenever it has a real origin: "local-only" describes
# how a finished change ships, not whether the clone is worth keeping current. Only
# a local-only project with NO origin remote keeps the benign skip, alongside
# projects missing a remote/branch and outright fetch failures.
# A local-only project's origin fetch is bounded
# (FM_FLEET_LOCAL_ONLY_FETCH_TIMEOUT_SECS, default 20s) so a slow or unreachable
# origin - e.g. an SMB-mounted checkout - cannot stall the whole sweep or session
# start; a fetch that exceeds the bound is reported as a loud "may be behind ...
# could not be refreshed in time" line rather than a silent drift or a hang. Every
# other mode's fetch stays unbounded, unchanged.
# Pruning never deletes the checked-out branch or a branch that still has a
# worktree, so it cannot discard unlanded work; set FM_FLEET_PRUNE=0 to disable it.
# When the fetch fails on an orphaned .git/packed-refs.lock (left by a ref rewrite
# killed mid-write - e.g. a timed-out bootstrap sync or a teardown process kill),
# it is retried with a bounded wait and removed only when provably stale; see
# fetch_with_packed_refs_lock_guard and the FM_FLEET_SYNC_PACKED_REFS_LOCK_* knobs.
# Usage: fm-fleet-sync.sh [<project-dir-or-name>]
# The single-project form accepts either a path (absolute, or relative to the
# caller's cwd) or a bare "<name>"/"projects/<name>" form, resolved against
# this home's projects dir ($FM_HOME/projects, or $FM_PROJECTS_OVERRIDE).
# Bare names and "projects/<name>" forms prefer this home's projects dir before
# falling back to an explicit path. Example: from anywhere,
# `fm-fleet-sync.sh dotfiles-private` syncs just that one clone, same as
# passing its full projects/dotfiles-private path.
